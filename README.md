# Port Scanner
## Description

This project is a simple Port Scanner implemented in Java. It scans a range of ports on a specified IP address to check which ports are open.

## Features

- Scans ports in the range 1-1024.
- Connects to each port and checks if it is open.
- Outputs the status of each port (open/closed).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/port-scanner.git
   cd port-scanner
   ```

2. Compile the Java code:
   ```bash
   javac PortScanner.java
   ```

3. Run the Port Scanner:
   ```bash
   java PortScanner <IP_ADDRESS>
   ```
   Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address you want to scan.

## Example

To scan the local machine:
```bash
java PortScanner 127.0.0.1
```

                try {
                    Socket s = new Socket();
                    s.connect(new InetSocketAddress("0.0.0.0", port), 1000);
                    System.out.println(port + ": OPEN");
                    s.close();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    // Continue to next port
